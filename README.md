# Bathroom Butler C++
 A C++ retro game 

A small arcade-like game about managing the queue of a bathroom.

Music done by VÃ­ctor Sedano (find him at @victorsedano18).

Send each person to the most appropriate bathroom according to their necessities, the overall goal is to last as long as possible and accumulate as many points as you can. Also, the game scales the difficulty of each level according to your performance.

There are two types of levels, score levels require fulfilling a point objective in order to proceed and in time levels, the player just needs to survive for a set amount of time.

Have fun!

This was originally a first-week project in a course in game development, the first project was organized like a game jam, the theme was FAMILY. 

Initially done as part of a course on modern computer graphics, imparted by Javier Agenjo, teacher of the UPF. The basis of the project was his framework which wraps around SDL2 and some of OpenGL's functionality.
