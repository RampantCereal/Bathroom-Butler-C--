# Bathroom Butler C++
 A C++ retro game 

This was originally a first-week project in a course in game development imparted by Javier Agenjo from UPF, the first project was organized like a game jam, the theme was FAMILY and the requirements were 2D graphics, low window res and it had to be playable with as many buttons as a NES controller had. 
The basis of the project was Javier Agenjo's framework which wraps around SDL2 and some of OpenGL's functionality.

A small arcade-like game about managing the queue of a bathroom.

Send each person to the most appropriate bathroom according to their necessities, the overall goal is to last as long as possible and accumulate as many points as you can.

This is the original version presented during the course, a Unity remake is available here:

Some of the features of the remake are different objectives for each round, performance based difficulty scaling and original music.
